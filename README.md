# DSA
A small collection of data structures, algorithms and related interview questions that may be helpful when preparing for technical interviews. This project was created in CMake and C++. Other languages will be added when time permits.

Interview questions and example code were collated from the following resources.
 - [C++ Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises](https://www.udemy.com/course-dashboard-redirect/?course_id=4453612)
 - [Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++](https://www.udemy.com/course/datastructurescncpp/learn/lecture/13190664?start=765#reviews)
 - [Casey Muratori's Intern Questions on the Molly Rocket YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MollyRocket/videos)
 - [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/)
